    "text55": "I learned to tell about my journey in a clear and coherent way and to show confidence. It was also very important for me to understand my career goals and which job opportunities best matched my ambitions.",
    "text56": "Stephanie manages to create a safe environment for whatever is your life moment. She listens to you without judgment and advises you on next steps in a positive and encouraging way, without being unrealistic. I strongly recommend mentoring with Stephanie to embrace this process of looking at yourself, ideas and career through her attentive and thoughtful eye.",

    "text57": "I did the WFY mentorship in one of the most difficult phases of my life. I was still in college, pregnant, very afraid of being rejected or judged in the Management Consulting recruitment processes.",
    "text58": "The mentorship gave me strength to keep dreaming, reminded me of my qualities and gave me security to overcome my fears. Thus, it was a key turning point for me, because not only did I learn how to master Case Interview (which I knew practically nothing about), but also had a huge moment of interpersonal rediscovery.",
    "text59": "I had a space to deeply reflect, organize who I was, what I had done so far, who I would like to become and how I would effectively do it. In a nutshell, Stephanie is fantastic! It was the best mentoring I've ever had as I've received cross offers from two top management consulting firms - McKinsey & Company and Kearney - and I've found the dream career progression for me!",

    "text60": "What Flows You mentorship was an essential process for me to get a new and better job in my career in Marketing & Advertising. I learned hard and soft skills on how to make a better resume, cover letter, and interview.",
    "text61": "After the mentorship I certainly see all the process of getting a new job with other eyes, more mature eyes, that allows me to be the protagonist of all this process.",
    "text62": "I am sure that all the things I've learned I will replicate always that I seek new job opportunities, but also in life: and this is one of the big differentials of WFY, not just you reach the specific goal that you shared with Stephanie at the beginning of the process, but you grow as individual to life. It is the right choice if you want to reach your most ambitious goals, or just want to know more about yourself.",

    "text63": "I am extremely grateful for the enriching experience of building each stage of the consulting recruitment process with What Flows You. From creating an excellent resume, and cover letter, to practicing guestimates, case and fit interviews. All of those with excellent feedback that truly demonstrates Stephanie's expertise.",
    "text64": "All of these approaches not only helped me secure a position in management consulting but also expanded my capacity for self-knowledge throughout the journey. The guidance provided in the WFY sessions was instrumental in my personal and professional growth.",
    "text65": "During and in-between the sessions, Stephanie always provided insightful advice, unwavering support, and genuine commitment to my development, which had a profound impact on me. One of the greatest values I gained with the mentorship was recognizing the importance of deep reflection and exchange of knowledge, both related to Consulting and general life topics, which has had a lasting impact.",
    "text66": "With a unique ability to inspire and motivate, Stephanie creates a learning environment that is unlike any other—extremely positive and constructive.",

    "text67": "During one of the most challenging times of my life, What Flows You offered me a brand-new perspective. After leaving a 5-year career that didn’t fulfill me in my home country, I was ready to start over in a new place.",
    "text68": "The WFY mentorship offered me expertise and support every step of the way, from choosing the country I'd like to go to and the immigration process, to job seeking. I knew searching for a job in a new country wouldn't be easy, but the WFY mentorship gave me the tools I needed to feel confident in my skills during the selection process. It was impressive how Stephanie was able to translate my story into a unique and memorable cover letter. She also helped me feel prepared for the interviews, overcoming my shyness.",
    "text69": "As a result, I secured 3 job offers abroad, and currently, I am working as an architect in Australia, increasing my salary more than 7 times compared to that in my home country. Thanks to the WFY mentorship, I feel much more empowered and recognized in my career, and I have a much better quality of life in the new country."

You have the right to be heard.",
    "text13": "For those who said \"<boldText>the protagonist</boldText>\", remember that usually you are the protagonist on some movies and series but not in others.
